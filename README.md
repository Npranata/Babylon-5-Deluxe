# Babylon-5
Authors:
Nathaniel Pranata, Malcolm Rousseau, Peter Robles

Project Description:
Babylon-5 is a bullet-hell game that is thematically inspired by Galaga. 
If one chooses to pull our code, they will see 6 total classes. 
The main class, SpaceshipGame.java, is where most of our methods come together to function as a Galaga-inspired bullet-hell game. 
Once the main class is running, the player will have to shoot the many enemy ships on screen by either tapping or holding the space-bar. 
To move the player’s ship, the player must move their track-pad or mouse to their desired location. 
Additionally, the player cannot destroy enemy ship lasers by shooting them. To win the game, 
the player must defeat all enemy ships and defeat the final boss (the hitbox of the boss is at his center). 
Only then do they have the option to continue the game (play the game with their current health, lives, and score) or exit back to the main menu. 
If the player’s ship is destroyed, their current lives are reduced by one. If there are no more lives, 
the player will have the option to return to the main menu. 
Please have Java 17 installed.

We utilized Bro Code’s video as a resource to help us play music using .wav files on java. 
What we learned from this resource is how to use the java.io package and java.sound package. 
Using Bro Code’s code from the video, we were able to sample our .wav file and loop it infinitely.

Known Issues:
There are no known bugs/issues.

Societal Impact:
Please note that this game was mainly tested/developed on MacBook Pro 13s using only the trackpad. Usage on
other devices is not guarenteed to run smoothly.
Also, all of the assets we used are gathered from outside resources, we do not claim ownership of the PNGs, music, and designs of ships. 
Being able to hold down the spacebar makes controlling the game more accessible to those who may be
physically impaired, as needing to repeatedly press the button can be strenuous. The combative nature of this game
may be triggering to some players. Due to the limited applications of this game, its societal impact is minimal.
